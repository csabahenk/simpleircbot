This is a Simple Irc Bot, customized to resolve
Bugzilla and Gerrit ids.

It needs the ruby-bugzilla gem, install with

  $ gem install ruby-bugzilla

Just specify the room, the Bugzilla and Gerrit paramenters
and launch "batty".

For writing your own bots:
- simpleircbot/core.rb is the "framework"
- see example/hellobot.rb for an example bot.
